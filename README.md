## **Project Overview**  
This repository contains our solutions for **ASME Prob2_DesignQA Hackathon 2025**, covering all six **DesignQA benchmark subsets**:  

1. **Retrieval**  
2. **Compilation**  
3. **Definition**  
4. **Presence**  
5. **Dimension**  
6. **Functional Performance**

## **API Key Setup**  
This project uses the **OpenAI API**.  
For security reasons, **no API key is included** in this repository.  

You must set your **own** API key as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY` before running any scripts.  

### **Mac / Linux (Terminal)**  
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
