Yes,"Explanation: The FEA simulation shows a maximum stress of 220 MPa, which is below the yield strength threshold of 240 MPa for non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum. Therefore, the battery structure meets the required strength criteria. Answer: Yes",__
No,"Explanation: The FEA simulation results show a maximum stress of 260 MPa, which exceeds the yield strength of 240 MPa specified in rule F.3.5.3b for non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum. Therefore, the battery structure does not meet the required strength criteria. Answer: No",__
Yes,"Explanation: The smallest woman accommodated has a standing height of 151.5 cm, while the 5th percentile female standing height is approximately 152.4 cm. The largest man accommodated has a standing height of 186.5 cm, which is below the 95th percentile male standing height of approximately 193 cm. Therefore, the vehicle does not meet the requirements of accommodating drivers from the 5th percentile female to the 95th percentile male. Measured 151.5 cm < required 152.4 cm → fails for smallest woman. Measured 186.5 cm < required 193 cm → fails for largest man. Answer: No",__
No,"Explanation: The vehicle accommodates a smallest woman at 151.5 cm (5th percentile) and a largest man at 186.5 cm (95th percentile). Since these dimensions meet the requirements of accommodating drivers from the 5th percentile female to the 95th percentile male, the vehicle complies with rule V.2.1.1. Answer: Yes",__
Yes,"Explanation: The calculated TS voltage values in the image do not exceed 400 V DC, indicating that a 10 kOhm resistor is appropriate for the TSMP as per rule EV.5.8.4, which allows a 10 kOhm resistor for voltages in the range of 200 V DC < Vmax <= 400 V DC. Therefore, the use of the resistor complies with the rule. Answer: Yes",__
No,"Explanation: The image shows a calculated TS voltage of 600 V, which falls into the range of 400 V DC < Vmax <= 600 V DC. According to rule EV.5.8.4, a 15 kOhm resistor is required for this voltage range, but a 10 kOhm resistor is proposed. Therefore, the proposed resistor does not meet the requirement. Answer: No",__
Yes,"Explanation: The force-displacement curve indicates that the peak load of the honeycomb impact attenuator is 60 kN, which meets the requirement set by rule F.8.7.2 for standard honeycomb impact attenuators. Since the measured peak load does not exceed the threshold, it is acceptable for use. Answer: Yes",__
No,"Explanation: The force-displacement curve indicates that the peak load for the honeycomb impact attenuator is 75 kN, which exceeds the maximum allowable peak load of 60 kN specified in rule F.8.7.2. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements for use in the vehicle. Answer: No",__
No,"Explanation: The FEA simulation results show a maximum stress of 250 MPa in the frame tubes. According to rule F.3.4.2b, the yield strength for welded properties is 180 MPa. Since 250 MPa exceeds the allowable yield strength, the assembly should not be used. Answer: No",__
Yes,"Explanation: The FEA simulation results show a maximum stress of 150 MPa, which is below the welded yield strength threshold of 180 MPa specified in rule F.3.4.2b. Since the maximum stress does not exceed the allowable limit, the assembly can be used in the vehicle. Answer: Yes",__
Yes,"Explanation: The analysis shows an input force of 2500 N applied by the driver, which exceeds the minimum required force of 2000 N as stated in rule T.3.2.2. Therefore, the inputs used in the analysis are correct and meet the rule's requirements. Answer: Yes",__
No,"Explanation: The analysis shows an input force of 1750 N applied to the brake pedal, which is below the required minimum force of 2000 N as stated in rule T.3.2.2. Therefore, the design does not meet the necessary threshold for the brake pedal and associated components. Answer: No",__
Yes,"Explanation: The measured temperatures from the gearbox components indicate a maximum of 250°C, which exceeds the 60°C threshold specified in rule T.1.6.1. Therefore, sufficient heat insulation is required to protect the driver from contact with these heated surfaces. Answer: No",__
No,"Explanation: The experimental results indicate that the gearbox components reached temperatures above 60°C, which exceeds the threshold set by rule T.1.6.1. Therefore, sufficient heat insulation is required to protect the driver from contact with these heated surfaces. Answer: No",__
Yes,"Explanation: The FEA simulation shows a maximum stress of 121.43 MPa on the motor mount. This value is below the yield strength of 240 MPa for non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum, indicating that the mount is within safe limits. Therefore, it meets the requirements set forth in rule F.3.5.3b. Answer: Yes",__
No,"Explanation: The FEA simulation shows a maximum stress of 362.13 MPa on the motor mount, which exceeds the yield strength of 240 MPa for non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum as specified in rule F.3.5.3b. Therefore, the motor mount does not meet the required strength criteria. Answer: No",__
